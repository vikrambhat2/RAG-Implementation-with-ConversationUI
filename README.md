The repository  demonstrates the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a conversational user interface (UI). The primary goal is to showcase how RAG models can be used to improve the interaction between users and systems by leveraging external information sources to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

The implementation includes a variety of use cases like querying CSV data using a pandas DataFrame, summarizing Reddit posts, and utilizing the Llama 3.2 model for RAG tasks. The system integrates with the LangChain library to create agents that handle these tasks, with a focus on enhancing the conversational aspects of the interface. By combining data retrieval with generative models, it enables more dynamic and context-aware conversations, where the system can access relevant external data to answer user queries effectively.
