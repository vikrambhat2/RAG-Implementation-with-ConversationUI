    "## Building a Conversational Chatbot with Custom Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the creation of a chatbot tailored to your specific data needs. We utilize Elastic Search as our vector storage solution and incorporate the \"meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat\" model from WatsonX's Large Language Models (LLM). The `langchain` library plays a crucial role in this process, aiding in tasks like chunking documents, indexing data in Elastic Search, managing conversation chains with memory buffers, and crafting prompt templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PDF Content Processing**: When users upload PDF files, the notebook extracts the text, segments it into manageable chunks, and indexes these chunks in Elastic Search using an appropriate `elser` model.\n",
    "- **Data-Driven Query Handling**: Users can pose questions to the chatbot, which searches the indexed data for relevant answers.\n",
    "- **Integrating Elastic Search and WatsonX LLMs**: We leverage `langchain`'s capabilities to link Elastic Search indexing with WatsonX's LLMs, enabling a seamless conversational experience with memory and retrieval functionalities.\n",
    "- **Hallucination Check**: The notebook includes a mechanism to detect and correct any hallucinations or inaccuracies in the LLM's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites for Running the Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Library Requirements**: Confirm that you have installed all libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.\n",
    "2. **Elastic Search ELSER Model Setup**: Implement an ELSER model within your Elastic Search instance. Refer to the Elastic documentation for setup details: [Elastic Machine Learning: ELSER](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html).\n",
    "3. **Environment Configuration**: A `.env` file is required, containing critical configuration details:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`elastic_search_url`**: This URL connects you to your Elastic Search instance, a search engine built on the Lucene library, offering distributed, multitenant capabilities for full-text search with a web interface and JSON document handling. The `elastic_search_url` serves as your point of interaction for tasks like data indexing and querying.\n",
    "   - **`elastic_search_api_key`**: A key for secure access to your Elastic Search instance, this API key is essential for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only permitted users and applications interact with your Elastic Search server.\n",
    "   - **`WATSONX_APIKEY`**: Your access key for IBM's WatsonX services, this API key is used for authenticating requests to WatsonX's AI and cognitive computing services. Acquire your WatsonX.ai URL and API key by following these instructions: [IBM Cloud: API Keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key) and [WatsonX as a Service Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=library-credentials).\n",
    "   - **`WATSONX_URL`**: The primary access point for WatsonX's API, this URL is where you connect to utilize WatsonX's diverse AI functionalities.\n",
    "   - **`WATSONX_Project_ID`**: A unique identifier for your project in the WatsonX environment, this ID helps manage and organize resources like datasets and AI models within your specified WatsonX project.Obtain a project ID for WatsonX AI, essential for project management within WatsonX. Guides for this can be found here: [Creating a WatsonX Project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=projects-creating-project), [Finding Your Project ID in IBM Cloud](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-project-id.html?context=wx).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`es_model_id`: This refers to the unique identifier of the Elastic Search (ES) model that's being used. Elastic Search models, like the ELSER model, are deployed within the Elastic Search environment to perform specific tasks such as text analysis, natural language processing, or vector search. The es_model_id helps in identifying and referencing the specific model deployed in your Elastic Search instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`index_name`: In the context of Elastic Search, an index_name denotes the name of the index where your data is stored. The index_name is used to specify which collection of documents you're querying or modifying in your Elastic Search operations. If the index is not already present, one with this name gets created during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "`llm_model_id`: This is the identifier for the Large Language Model (LLM) from WatsonX that you're using. WatsonX provides various AI models, including LLMs for different tasks like conversation, text completion, or language translation. The llm_model_id allows you to specify which of these models you want to interact with in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "`wx_url`: This variable represents the URL for the WatsonX service. WatsonX, being a cloud-based service, can be accessed through its dedicated URL. This URL is used to make API requests, authenticate your application, and access the services provided by WatsonX, like their LLMs or other AI functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "`wx_project_id`: The wx_project_id is a unique identifier for a project within the WatsonX ecosystem. In WatsonX, a project is a workspace where you can organize resources, data, models, and other assets. Each project has a unique ID which is used to access and manage the resources within that specific project. This ID ensures that your interactions with the WatsonX API are scoped and managed within the right project context."

    "### Conversation UI\n",
    "This Python code leverages the `panel` library to construct an interactive chatbot interface. It features a text input field where you can pose questions, alongside a primary-styled submission button. Upon submission, the entered query triggers a callback function that fetches responses from a pre-defined `conversation_chain`. The response is validated against source documents for accuracy, and if no relevant information is found, a default message is displayed. The chat's flow, comprising both queries and responses, is dynamically updated and displayed in a markdown pane, designed to support vertical scrolling. This setup not only facilitates user interaction with the chatbot but also ensures the reliability of the information provided, enhancing the overall user experience."
